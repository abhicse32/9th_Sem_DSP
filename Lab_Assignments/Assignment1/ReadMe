Assuming that your current working directory is "Curr_Directory"
1. Download your codes, for both Lab and Home Assignments, from moodle as well as private-testcases, solutions and evaluation script

2. extract all compressed archives in "Curr_Directory"

3. Create a directory named as <Your_Roll_Number_in_Capital_Letters>_PA1, ex- CS15B001_PA1

4. Next, copy/move all your lab and home-work codes in the directory CS15B0XX_PA1

5. Rename home-work files as hw1_1.c, hw1_2.c .... and Lab-Assignment files as lab1_1.c and lab1_2.c, if you have not done this already


Finally tree-view of your directory-structure must look like as following(Assuming that you deleted everything else)

		+Curr_Directory
		|
		|___+CS15XXXX_PA1
		|	|
		|	|___hw1_1.c
		|	|___hw1_2.c
		|	|___hw1_3.c
		|	|___hw1_4.c
		|	|___hw1_5.c
		|	|___lab1_1.c
		|	|___lab1_2.c
		|
		|___run
		|___+testcases
		|___+solutions

Where, testcases and solutions directories contain private testcases and their corresponding solutions respectively

6. Assuming that you have followed the above mentioned instructions, type "./eval CS15XXXX", this will generate a file named as results.txt in "Curr_Directory"

7. Check your results for each question and look at corresponding solution if getting "failed" for any, and try to figure out the reasons by debugging your codes.

8. Finally, you can approach TAs, with all the modifications you've made, after you're done with everything mentioned above and still not satisfied with the evaluation.
