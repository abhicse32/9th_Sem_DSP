Do the following to compile and run your code.

1. Download the resources containing this ReadMe file :P 

2. place your program directory, i.e. "CS15B0XX_HOME" in the directory "Submissions"

3. type $./run    - this will compile your programs and create executables in the directory named "executables", outputs in the directory named "outputs" and results(for each line/testcase) in the file "result.txt" and all inside "Code" directory

4. type $./run2    - same as above, except this will generate results in the file "results.txt" which will contains the final results and will be created in the current working directory
