1. Extract all the program files of the students assigned to you in the Submissions directory included in the attachments 

2. run the test_creator script which will create directories with names as students' roll numbers and put their corresponding program files in the directories with their roll numbers.

3. In program files for q2 of each student do the following
	
	a) change MAX_SIZE to 50
	b) replace the main function with following main function

	int main (){
	   int i, option, which, action;
	   char what;

	   srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));

	   printf("Enter strategy -- 0 (odd-even) or 1 (colliding) : ");
	   scanf("%d",&option);
	   printf("%d\n",option);
	   initStack(option);

	   i = 0;
	   int times,letter;
	   scanf("%d",&times);
	   while (i<times) {
	      ++i;
	      printf("Iteration %3d : ", i); fflush(stdout);

	      /* Initially make push. Then make push twice as likely as pop. */
	      // if (i <= 8) action = 1;
	      // else action = rand() % 3;
	      scanf("%d",&action);

	      /* Make Stack 1 twice more active than Stack 2 */
	      // which = (rand() % 3) ? 1 : 2;
	      scanf("%d",&which);
	      scanf("%d",&letter);
	      if (action) { /* Push */
	         what = ((which == 1) ? 'a' : 'A') + letter;
	         printf("Push %c in stack %d. New stack : ",what,which); fflush(stdout);
	         pushStack(which,what,option);
	      } else {      /* Pop */
	         printf("Pop    in stack %d. New stack : ",which); fflush(stdout);
	         popStack(which,option);
	      }
	      printStack();
	   }
   return(0);
}


5. In program files for q1 of each student, do following
	
	a) in function genRandList() comment the first two lines and add scanf as following

	  // q -> x = 1000 + rand() % 9000;
      // q -> y = 1000 + rand() % 9000;
      scanf("%d%d",&(q->x),&(q->y));

    b) in main, add the first two lines of the following 3 lines and change the parameter passed to genRandList to n 

   	int n;
   	scanf("%d",&n);
   	L = genRandList(n);

6. finally run the "run" script which will generate the results of each student in the directories with their roll numbers in the file named "results.txt"

7. Update the results in the moodle

8. Notify in the groupy, when done :P
